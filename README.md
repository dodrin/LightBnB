# Lighthouse BnB

A simple multi-page Airbnb clone that uses a server-side Javascript to display the information from queries to web pages via SQL queries.

This project was a part of my learnings at lighthouse labs.

### What I leaned through this project

1. Design and create the database and tables using ERD
2. Use the psql CLI to interact with and explore a database
3. User asynchronous postgres JS libraries to query data from Node appliacations

### Things to note

There are a few minor bugs that won't display some of the data due to the original data not existing anymore or simply not added since it was not the part of the course.
